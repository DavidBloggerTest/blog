## Introduction

The English (International) version of this blog started in September 2024 and I wrote a few technical articles then. In early December 2024, I decided to start a Chinese version of the blog.

## Separation

Because the Chinese blog was newly created, I do not want to translate all the English articles back to Chinese and simply post them here. I decided to separate the two versions. They will display contents that do not overlap completely.

## The Future

The Chinese blog will display articles mainly about my development and life while the International blog will be mainly technical sharing. Their contents will have overlaps but will not be the same.

Currently Google hasn't indexed both of my blogs but I wish to attract more readers in the future. I will write more high-quality articles and wish this site could increase in popularity.

Thank you for your support!
