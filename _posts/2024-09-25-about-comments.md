## How It Works

Comments on my site are powered by Gitalk. Gitalk is a commenting widget that is powered by GitHub Issues and Preact.

A comment with Gitalk is actually a comment under a issue in the [comment repository](https://github.com/davidasx/blog-comments-davidx). What Gitalk does is syncing the website\'s comments with GitHub\'s comments.

## Posting Comments

Any user with a GitHub handle can post comments under my blogs. Your avatar and nickname will be your GitHub avatar and handle. You don\'t need to set up anything else.

Please do not post spam or rude comments. Such comments will be deleted and accounts that post spam too often will be blocked.

You should write your comments in English only.

Markdown is supported for all comments so please enjoy!

See you in the comments section!
